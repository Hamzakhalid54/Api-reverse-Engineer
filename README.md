**API Reverse Engineer** is a professional-grade Chrome Extension designed for Developers, QA Engineers, and Security Researchers. It sits silently in your DevTools panel, intercepts background network traffic (`fetch`/`XHR`), and **automatically reconstructs the entire architectural blueprint of any web application you browse.**

Stop digging through chaotic Network tabs in DevTools. Start exploring a structured, automatically generated API Map.

## 🔒 Unlock The Core Schema Engine (Missing File)

> [!WARNING]
> **Notice:** The file `utils/schemaParser.js` is intentionally omitted from this public repository. This file contains the proprietary recursive parsing algorithms that power the **Database Schema Inference** and **TypeScript Interface Generation** features. Without this file, the extension will capture traffic but will not be able to reconstruct JSON relational mapping.

**Want access to the core Schema Engine?**  
1. ⭐ **Star this repository** at the top right of the page.
2. 📩 Open an Issue titled: `Access Request: Schema Engine`.
3. I will verify you starred the repo and grant you private access to the missing file!

## ⚡ What Does It Actually Do?

As you click around a website, the extension watches the traffic and builds an intelligent workspace. Tools like *BurpSuite* or *OWASP ZAP* charge thousands of dollars for these automated discovery pipelines. This extension does it for free right in your browser.

- **📡 Automatic REST & GraphQL Detection:** Seamlessly groups chaotic network calls by Base URL and Endpoint Paths (e.g., collapses `/users/1` and `/users/2` into `GET /users/:id`).
- **🏗️ Database Schema Inference:** Automatically builds strong JSON schema interfaces and infers underlying SQL/NoSQL table relationships by analyzing the nested structures of intercepted response bodies.
- **�️ Deep Hidden Endpoint Discovery:** Uses a 4-pronged heuristic engine (JS Bundle regex scanning, Response JSON crawling, ID Pattern inference, and Dictionary whitelists) to discover internal/admin APIs that *haven't even been called yet*.
- **📊 Execution Flow Waterfall:** Visualizes the exact chronological order of API calls (e.g. `Page Load ↓ /getCsrfToken ↓ /getUser`).
- **📁 Dependency Directory Tree:** Renders cleanly formatted ASCII tree topologies of the API's routing structure.
- **🛡️ Security Scanner:** Automatically flags exposed Personally Identifiable Information (PII), missing authentication headers, verbose stack traces, and CORS misconfigurations.
- **🚀 One-Click Code Scrapers:** Instantly converts any intercepted network call into a copy-pasteable script in `cURL`, `Axios (Node)`, `Fetch`, or `Python Requests`.
- **📝 Automated Documentation:** Generates a beautiful HTML documentation page, an OpenAPI 3.0 specification file, or a full Postman Collection encompassing every endpoint captured during your session.

## 🧠 How It Works Under The Hood

The extension leverages the native `chrome.devtools.network` API via Manifest V3. 

1. **Interception:** A background listener captures requested URLs, methods, headers, and payloads.
2. **Filtering:** Advanced telemetry filters instantly drop analytics, metrics, and tracking pixel payloads (`/log`, `/events`) before they enter memory so your API map stays pristine and focused on core business logic.
3. **In-Memory Parsing:** Responses under 2MB are parsed through pattern-matching algorithms to detect Pagination logic (`?limit=`, `?cursor=`) and Authentication schemas (`Bearer`, `X-API-Key`).
4. **No Cloud Dependency:** 100% of the traffic parsing, schema generation, and code generation happens **locally on your machine**. Absolutely zero network data is sent to external servers.

## 📦 Installation

This extension is built entirely on standard Web APIs and requires no build steps or heavy frameworks.

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/api-reverse-engineer.git
   ```
2. Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable **Developer mode** via the toggle switch in the top right corner.
4. Click the **Load unpacked** button and select the folder containing this extension's code.

## 💻 How to Use It on a Target Website

1. Navigate to the web application you want to analyze.
2. Open **Chrome DevTools** (`F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` / `Cmd+Option+I`).
3. Click the new **"API Reverse Engineer"** tab at the top of the DevTools panel.
4. Browse the target application like a normal user. Click buttons, open modals, and submit forms.
5. Watch the DevTools panel instantly categorize traffic, reverse-engineer the database schema, guess hidden endpoints, and generate Postman collections in real-time.

*(Optional)* To unlock AI functionality (if you have the unlocked file), enter your Google Gemini API key securely in the top right of the panel. This is stored utilizing Chrome's secure local storage API.
